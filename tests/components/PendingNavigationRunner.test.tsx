/**
 * The React half of navigation published from outside React.
 *
 * Callers that cannot safely touch expo-router (a notification tap handler at
 * bundle-entry scope, a desktop revocation in the connection lifecycle) publish
 * to a module-level slot; this component consumes it from inside the mounted
 * navigator and performs the call. That split exists because `router.push` and
 * `router.navigate` only ENQUEUE: the queue is drained by a React effect that
 * throws when no navigator has mounted yet, which crashed iOS on a cold-start
 * notification tap in 0.6.3 build 13.
 *
 * NOTE the crash itself cannot be reproduced at this tier. expo-router supplies
 * INITIAL_METRICS when NODE_ENV === 'test' (ExpoRoot.js), so the
 * SafeAreaProvider gate that opens the window on device does not exist here.
 * These cases therefore pin the INVARIANT - one publish performs exactly once,
 * and only from inside React - which is what makes the fix non-regressible.
