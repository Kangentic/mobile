/**
 * Pins two real defects found in `eslint.config.mjs` on this branch (both
 * already fixed in the working tree), plus the three-way split of the
 * imperative-router ban described below. Nothing else in the repo checks that a
 * lint rule actually FIRES where it is supposed to - `tsc` cannot see a
 * misconfigured ESLint rule, and a config that "looks correct" but silently
 * stops matching is exactly the failure mode here. So this test drives real
 * ESLint (`ESLint#lintText`, the same engine `npm run lint` uses), not
 * `calculateConfigForFile`, which would only prove the options object looks
 * right without proving it resolves.
 *
 * Defect A: flat config's last-match-wins REPLACES a rule's options rather
 * than merging them. The `expo-haptics` `no-restricted-imports` entry has a
 * glob (`src/**\/*.ts` etc.) that is a superset of the crypto/push directory
 * entry's files (`src/pairing/**`, `src/channel/**`, ...), and used to sit
 * AFTER it - so it became the only live `no-restricted-imports` config for
 * those directories and silently disabled the `crash-reporting-scope.md`
 * observability ban there. Fixed by reordering the haptics entry before the
 * directory entry and restating the haptics `paths` inside the directory
 * entry.
 *
 * Defect B: the `useAnimatedProps` ban was a single selector
 * `CallExpression[callee.name='useAnimatedProps']`, which matches only an
 * unqualified call. `import * as Reanimated from 'react-native-reanimated'`
 * then `Reanimated.useAnimatedProps(...)` has a MemberExpression callee and
 * slipped straight through - and that namespaced form is already the house
 * style in this repo's own test files. Fixed by adding a second selector,
 * `CallExpression[callee.property.name='useAnimatedProps']`.
 *
 * Every case here asserts "does this rule actually fire", not "is this
 * option present in the resolved config" - a config that looks right and
 * does not resolve is the whole class of bug this file exists to catch.
