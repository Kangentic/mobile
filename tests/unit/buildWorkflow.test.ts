/**
 * Guards the build workflows against the ways they can silently rot.
 *
 * The Android workflow builds with Gradle rather than `eas build`, so eas.json is
 * no longer read by the build tool itself. That is a deliberate trade (see the CI
 * builds section of docs/developer-guide.md), and these tests are what keeps it
 * honest: the workflow's profile list must stay equal to eas.json's, which is
 * the EAS profile anchor named in .claude/rules/docs-stay-in-sync.md.
 *
 * The release-gate groups cover the safety gates on the Play submit job and the
 * iOS upload step. Those are the difference between "a release needs a
 * deliberate decision" and "a release happens because someone clicked Run
 * workflow".
 *
 * The iOS group additionally locks two orderings and one logging rule that are
 * each load bearing and none of which any other check would catch.
 *
 * The R8 groups (build-android's mapping-file upload, ci.yml's gradle.properties
 * and Sentry Android Gradle Plugin checks, and build-ios's dSYM check) lock the
 * CI enforcement steps and workflow wiring that keep a minified release
 * symbolicatable. app.config.ts's own R8 flags are covered separately, in
 * tests/unit/appConfigBrand.test.ts.
