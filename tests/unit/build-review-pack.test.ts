/**
 * Unit coverage for scripts/build-review-pack.mjs, the /code-review shared-pack builder.
 *
 * Nothing exercised this script before: no test anywhere ran it end to end, yet other
 * agents in the review fan-out literally size their `Read` offset/limit calls off the
 * "Total lines: N" header it writes at the top of .kangentic/REVIEW_PACK.tmp.md. An
 * undercounted header truncates a downstream agent's last read silently.
 *
 * The script has no exports (it is a standalone node ESM CLI), so this drives it end to
 * end against a throwaway git repository created under os.tmpdir() and inspects the pack
 * file it writes. Never point it at this checkout's own repo root: doing so would
 * overwrite .kangentic/REVIEW_PREEXISTING_DIRTY.tmp, which an in-flight review pass may
 * depend on.
 *
 * The pack has one format: every changed file is exactly one section, and every body line is
 * `<marker><line number, 5 wide><tab><text>` with "+" added, " " unchanged, and "-" removed
 * (no number, shown in place before the line that follows it). A file admitted under the body
 * cap is "## Full file:" or "## Partial file:" (hunks with 20 lines of context); every other
 * readable file is "## Changed hunks:" (3 lines of context). There is no separate union diff.
 * The behaviors pinned:
 *
 * 1. The "Total lines: N" header always matches the pack file's actual line count,
 *    including the trailing "## Not included (read on demand)" section that appears
 *    whenever a changed file's content is absent (oversized, binary, or a stubbed hunk
 *    section). Before the fix, N was derived from the table-of-contents cursor arithmetic,
 *    which stopped advancing once the packed sections ended and never accounted for the
 *    omitted-files block - undercounting by 1 + omittedCount whenever anything was omitted.
 *
 * 2. parseNumstat resolves git's rename notation to the new path via resolveNumstatPath, in
 *    both the arrow form ("old => new") and the brace form ("dir/{old => new}"). The symptom
 *    that pins it is the changed-file list, not the churn ranking: committedNames is built
 *    from the churn map's own keys, so an unresolved key becomes a bogus extra changed file
 *    (the old path, which no longer exists) beside the new one. Ranking cannot catch it,
 *    because churnOf falls back to the independent two-dot hunk count for any path missing
 *    from the churn map, and that fallback lands on the same count either way. Both forms
 *    were verified by mutating the resolver: the ranking assertion stayed green, the
 *    changed-file assertions went red.
 *
 * 3. Every "- line N: <label>" table-of-contents entry points at the exact line where its
 *    own section heading starts, and every changed file has exactly one heading. A windowed
 *    section is the harder case: its rendered length is the shown lines plus one line per
 *    elision marker plus one line per removed line, not the file's line count, so the cursor
 *    must advance by what was written. This bit during development: the first section's own
 *    heading line was uncounted in the cursor arithmetic, sending every TOC entry to a blank
 *    line instead of its heading, and the only reason it was caught was manual verification,
 *    not a test. The second header line (the format legend) is part of that arithmetic too.
 *
 * 4. A file that pushes the packed bodies over PACK_BODY_CAP_BYTES (200KB) is not given a
 *    body; it is packed at the hunk tier ("## Changed hunks:", every changed line with 3 lines
 *    of context and exact numbers), and it is NOT listed under "## Not included", because it
 *    carries every changed line. A hunk-tier section that alone exceeds
 *    PACK_HUNK_SECTION_CAP_BYTES (100KB) becomes a one-line "## Changed hunks omitted:" stub
 *    and IS listed there. The cap is a fact about the file alone, never about what else
 *    changed: a smaller hunk-tier file beside a stubbed one keeps its hunks.
 *
 * 5. The stdout "  paths: " line carries every changed file across all three layers
 *    (committed-vs-base, uncommitted, untracked), and is distinct from the "  changed files: "
 *    count line above it. This is the line /code-review's SKILL.md tells the driver to read
 *    for `changedFiles`: it is the script's own array, so it cannot disagree with the pack.
 *    The TOC now lists every changed file too, and the two are asserted to match one-to-one.
 *
 * 6. The script exits 0 on both the empty-diff and non-empty-diff paths, so only the
 *    literal "NO CHANGES:" stdout prefix (never the exit status) tells a caller which case
 *    it hit - and on that path neither REVIEW_PACK.tmp.md nor REVIEW_PREEXISTING_DIRTY.tmp
 *    is written at all.
 *
 * 7. Two context-expanded windows within WINDOW_MERGE_GAP_LINES (5) of each other merge into
 *    one contiguous window with no elision marker between them, rather than staying separate
 *    and paying an extra marker line for a gap that small.
 *
 * 8. A pure-deletion hunk ("@@ -a,b +N,0 @@", nothing on the new side) anchors its window at
 *    the collapse point N rather than the general start/end formula, which would invert to
 *    [N, N - 1] for a zero-length hunk - a silent one-line-short window (the trailing context
 *    stops at N + WINDOW_CONTEXT_LINES - 1 instead of N + WINDOW_CONTEXT_LINES) rather than a
 *    loud failure, because the context expansion on both sides rescues the inverted range from
 *    the later end >= start filter for any realistically sized file. The removed lines render
 *    in place, between the two surviving neighbours.
 *
 * 9. Window context is clamped at both file boundaries: an edit within WINDOW_CONTEXT_LINES
 *    (20) of line 1 or of the file's last line never reads past either end of the lines array.
 *
 * 10. Every elision marker's own arithmetic, not just its textual shape, is correct: the
 *     reported skip count equals its range's line span, and the range itself abuts the shown
 *     line numbers immediately surrounding it (or the file's first/last line at a boundary),
 *     looking through removed lines, which carry no number.
 *
 * 11. WINDOW_MAX_SHARE_OF_FULL (0.85) is enforced at its actual boundary, not merely at the
 *     extremes: a windowed body whose byte share lands fractionally ABOVE 0.85 still renders
 *     as "## Full file:", and one whose share lands fractionally BELOW renders as
 *     "## Partial file:".
 *
 * 12. WINDOW_MERGE_GAP_LINES (5) is a "less-than-or-equal" comparison against the
 *     CONTEXT-EXPANDED gap between two windows, not the raw hunk-to-hunk distance: two windows
 *     exactly 5 lines apart (post-expansion) merge, while two windows 6 lines apart stay
 *     separate with a marker reporting exactly 5 omitted lines.
 *
 * 13. Every rendered line carries the right marker: "+" on an added line, " " on an unchanged
 *     one, "-" with a blank number field on a removed line, rendered in place - before the
 *     first line of the hunk that replaced it, after the collapse point of a pure deletion,
 *     before line 1 for a deletion at the top of the file, and before the phantom empty last
 *     line for a deletion at the end of a newline-terminated file. A file changed in a commit
 *     and reverted in the working tree, a deleted file, a pure rename, and a binary each get
 *     their own one-line (or hunks-only) section, so the pack never claims a body it cannot
 *     show. The same file rendered with `--body-cap 0` (the light shape) is a
 *     "## Changed hunks:" section at 3 lines of context with the same markers.
 *
 * 14. The pack is byte-identical under hostile local git config: the seven `-c` pins plus
 *     `--no-ext-diff`. Every rendered byte now derives from the one `--unified=0` merge-base
 *     parse, so a lost prefix pin would switch the WHOLE parse off, not just windowing.
 *
 * 15. A missing or non-numeric --body-cap value exits 2 with a stderr message, from the
 *     argv-parsing loop, before the script ever calls git.
 *
 * 16. A mode-only change (the executable bit flips, content unchanged) is a one-line
 *     "## Not shown:" section naming the transition, e.g. "mode 100644 -> 100755".
 *
 * 17. A tracked file that stays over SINGLE_FILE_CAP_BYTES (1MB) even after its edit, with a
 *     small parsed hunk, is packed at the hunk tier under the OTHER arm of hunkSectionFor's
 *     "kind === 'hunks-only'" split: "## Changed hunks: <path> (over 1MB, body not read; ...)",
 *     rendered with renderHunksOnly's 0 lines of context - not the "## Deleted file:" heading,
 *     and not the per-file-hunk-cap stub, as long as the small edit's own rendered section
 *     stays under that cap.
 *
 * 18. The stub heading's own over-cap ternary has two arms: a stub for a DELETED file whose
 *     hunk-tier section alone exceeds PACK_HUNK_SECTION_CAP_BYTES (100KB) says "deleted file",
 *     not "read on demand" - the heading built earlier in hunkSectionFor is fully overwritten,
 *     never merged with the stub text.
 *
 * 19. A genuinely empty file gets its own two reasons under "## Not shown:": adding one is
 *     "new file, empty" and deleting an already-empty one is "deleted, was empty". Both must be
 *     driven as two SEPARATE diffs: git's rename detector treats any two empty (or otherwise
 *     byte-identical) files as 100% similar, so an add and a delete of empty files in the SAME
 *     diff pair into a rename instead ("renamed from ..., content unchanged"), never exercising
 *     either reason - confirmed empirically against a scratch repo before this fixture was written.
 *
 * 20. resolveNumstatPath's brace-notation branch ("prefix{old => new}suffix", the form git emits
 *     for a rename with a shared path prefix or suffix, e.g. "dir/{a.txt => b.txt}") resolves to
 *     the true new path, the same as the plain arrow form (#2) resolves for a root-level rename.
 *     Churn RANKING cannot tell a broken brace resolution from a working one: churnOf() falls
 *     back to the independent two-dot-parse hunk count whenever a path is missing from the
 *     numstat-keyed churn map, and that fallback lands on the same line count either way. The
 *     real, load-bearing symptom is in changedFiles itself: parseNumstat's churn map is keyed
 *     directly off whatever resolveNumstatPath returns, and committedNames (which feeds
 *     changedFileSet) is built from that map's keys - so an unresolved or wrong resolution
 *     leaves the WRONG path (the raw brace notation, or the old pre-rename name) as its own
 *     bogus entry in changedFiles, the "paths:" line, and the pack, in ADDITION to the correctly
 *     detected new path (which the changeRecordOnlyNames union step rescues independently, since
 *     the two-dot parse only ever saw the real new path). Confirmed empirically against this
 *     script: swapping which capture group the arrow-form branch returns leaves the sibling
 *     rename test's churn-ranking assertion green (bodies packed, ranking, and content all still
 *     correct via the fallback) while adding a bogus extra "changed files" entry and its own
 *     spurious "## Not shown:" section for the stale old path - the bug the count/paths
 *     assertions below are aimed at, not ranking order.
 *
 * 21. An untracked file that is genuinely empty gets its own "## Not shown:" reason, "new,
 *     untracked, empty" - distinct from a STAGED empty add's "new file, empty" (#19), which
 *     takes a different branch of noteReasonFor (the `parsed` file record exists for a staged
 *     file; an untracked file never has one).
 *
 * 22. `--out-dir <path>` puts BOTH output files in that directory, resolved against the cwd and
 *     created if missing, and writes nothing to .kangentic/. The review skill points it at its
 *     session scratchpad (in the desktop repo, stopping an ephemeral worktree preview empties the
 *     worktree's .kangentic/), and Step 8 reads the dirty list back from whichever directory this
 *     names. The
 *     NO CHANGES path still writes nothing anywhere, and a missing value (or a flag where the
 *     path should be) exits 2 before git runs.
 *
 * 23. `--shard-lines <N>` prints a `  shards:` line whose ranges start on a section heading, never
 *     split a section, run contiguously from the first section to the pack's last line, and stay
 *     within N lines unless one section alone is bigger (that section is then a shard of its own).
 *     Packing is greedy in pack order, so the next shard's first section never fits in the
 *     previous shard. The header range ends on the line before the first section.
 *
 * Not covered, and why: a C-quoted path (a quote, backslash, or control character in a file
 * name) lands its raw block under "## Union diff (unparsed)". NTFS forbids those characters,
 * so the fixture cannot be created on the Windows machines this suite also runs on.
