/**
 * Covers the mock desktop's FIXTURE CONTENT, not its wire behaviour.
 *
 * These fixtures are the source for every committed store screenshot
 * (scripts/storeScreenshots.mjs, .maestro/screenshots/store-capture.yaml), so
 * they are published to the App Store, to Play, and to a public repo, captioned
 * as a customer using the product. That makes their text a product claim rather
 * than test data, and it is the one part of this repo where being wrong is
 * invisible to every other check: a frame with the wrong words in it is still
 * the right pixel size, still named correctly, and still verifies.
 *
 * Two things went wrong before these tests existed, both caught only by a human
 * looking at a PNG:
 *
 *  1. Cards describing KANGENTIC'S OWN backlog shipped as the fictional
 *     customer's work - the register-push capability migration, the relay
 *     self-host guide, the terminal font-fit heuristic, and a flaky pairing
 *     flow whose body text read "the QR-scan step races the relay handshake".
 *  2. The terminal frame and the changes frame described DIFFERENT work: the
 *     terminal edited `src/router/index.ts`, which appears in no diff the
 *     Changes lens lists, and reported line counts that did not add up to what
 *     the file list claimed for the file it did edit.

/**
 * Regression for b4c89f0 ("TWO PLAYBACK LEAKS"): the recorded-terminal replay

 * respawn case is the worse one - activeSessionId is NOT null there, so a
 * playback left running would emit the dead session's recorded bytes into the
 * SUCCESSOR's terminal.
 *
 * There is no exported seam onto createMockDesktop()'s internal
 * terminalPlayback state (driving it for real needs a full loopback KK
 * handshake, which nothing in this repo does yet for this module - see the
 * fixture-content-only tests elsewhere in this file), so this checks the
 * WIRING structurally instead: both lifecycle functions must call
 * stopTerminalPlayback(). Cheap insurance against reintroduction, same
 * technique tests/unit/xtermPageScripts.test.ts uses to pin refit()'s body.
