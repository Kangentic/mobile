/**
 * Removes fields Sentry does not need for a crash report from an
 * accountless, E2E-encrypted app: no per-device user identity, no captured
 * HTTP request (this app makes none through Sentry's instrumentation, but
 * the field exists on every event), no arbitrary `extra`, no server name
 * (this app has no server), no captured HTTP response context.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, AND WHY: an event's stack frames cannot be scoped by
 * source file here. Under Expo, @sentry/react-native's rewrite-frames
 * integration replaces every frame's `filename` with one constant bundle
 * name (`app:///index.android.bundle` / `app:///main.jsbundle`) before
 * beforeSend ever runs - real source paths are resolved only server-side,
 * after ingestion, from the uploaded source map. A per-module redaction
 * rule ("if the top frame is under src/notifications/, redact the
 * message") is therefore not implementable on-device and is not attempted.
 *
 * What keeps src/pairing/**, src/channel/** and src/notifications/**
 * content out of Sentry is upstream of this function: those directories
 * cannot import Sentry at all (ESLint-enforced, see
 * .claude/rules/crash-reporting-scope.md), and their own long-standing
 * convention is to catch and discard every error without logging or
 * rethrowing it (.claude/rules/e2e-notification-privacy.md).
 *
 * That is a partial guard, not an invariant, and this comment used to
 * overstate it. The import ban only stops a DELIBERATE capture call; an
 * error from those directories that escapes uncaught is still picked up by
 * the global handler and arrives here with its message intact, because
 * `exception.value` is deliberately never touched (reporting the message is
 * the point). EXPECTED_TRANSPORT_NOISE in crashReporting.ts exists exactly
 * because channel errors do arrive today. The rule file names this gap.
