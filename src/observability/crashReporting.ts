/**
 * Crash and error reporting. Deliberately narrow: this app reports that it
 * broke and where in the code, and nothing about what the user was doing or
 * what their agent session contained.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTROLS LOOK LIKE THIS. A JavaScript `beforeSend` hook does NOT
 * filter native events - a hard iOS/Android crash is captured and sent by
 * sentry-cocoa / sentry-android and never passes through the JS layer at
 * all. So every control here is set at its SOURCE (an integration removed,
 * a feature disabled) rather than in a scrubber, because a scrubber cannot
 * reach the native path. This matters most for breadcrumbs: JS breadcrumbs
 * are synced into the native scope, so a console breadcrumb captured in JS
 * rides a native crash straight past `beforeSend`. Console breadcrumbs are
 * ON by default, which is why they are turned off explicitly below.
 *
 * KNOW WHERE THAT ARGUMENT STOPS. Only some of these options reach native.
 * `@sentry/react-native` destructures `beforeSend`, `beforeBreadcrumb` and
 * `integrations` out of the options before calling `initNativeSdk` (see
 * dist/js/wrapper.js), so the breadcrumb hardening below governs the JS
 * scope ONLY. sentry-cocoa and sentry-android keep their own default
 * auto-breadcrumbs (app foreground/background, activity or view-controller
 * lifecycle, connectivity and system events) and those ride a native crash
 * unfiltered. They carry no session content, but do not read the block
 * below as covering them: closing that needs native config through a config
 * plugin. Same story for iOS app-hang and watchdog-termination reporting,
 * left at their native defaults (on) deliberately, because a hang and an
 * out-of-memory kill are the app breaking, which is what this reports.
 * `sendDefaultPii`, `attachScreenshot`, `attachViewHierarchy`,
 * `maxBreadcrumbs`, `ignoreErrors` and `enableAutoSessionTracking` DO reach
 * native (RNSentryModuleImpl.java bridges each explicitly).
 *
 * See docs/security.md and .claude/rules/crash-reporting-scope.md.

/**
 * Errors that are normal operating conditions on a phone, not defects. A
 * mobile app loses its socket constantly (tunnel, lift, screen off). Left
 * unfiltered these alone would exhaust the free tier's 5,000 events/month
 * without describing a single real bug.
 *
 * The last two match `src/channel/relayTransport.ts` verbatim (lines 137,
 * 142, 164, 190). The first does NOT come from this repo at all: "Network
 * request failed" is React Native's own networking-bridge message for a
 * failed fetch/XHR, so grepping src/ for it finds nothing. Keep the
 * distinction in mind when editing: the relayTransport strings break if
 * that file is reworded, the RN one breaks if React Native rewords it.
 *
 * That these exist at all is worth reading twice. They are only necessary
 * because uncaught channel errors DO reach Sentry through the global
 * handler, which is the gap named under Known limitations in
 * .claude/rules/crash-reporting-scope.md.
