/**
 * Performs the navigation published to the pending slot, from INSIDE the
 * mounted navigator. See `pendingNavigation.ts` for why nothing outside React
 * may call the router directly.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO `navigationRef.isReady()` GUARD HERE. It would look like the
 * obvious safety check and it would break this: react-navigation registers the
 * focus listener that `isReady()` tests inside a PASSIVE effect
 * (useFocusedListenersChildrenAdapter), on the root navigator, which is an
 * ANCESTOR of the root layout. Passive effects run child-first, so at this
 * component's effect `isReady()` is still false on the very commit the
 * navigator mounts - a blocking guard here would defer with no retry signal and
 * silently drop the navigation.
 *
 * Calling the router here is nonetheless correct: expo-router's drain effect
 * lives further up the tree than this component, so it runs AFTER the
 * navigator's own effect in the same commit and re-checks readiness itself.
 * Correctness comes from tree position, not from a runtime predicate - which is
 * why this must stay a descendant of the navigation container, rendered after
 * the navigator itself.
