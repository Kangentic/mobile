/**
 * The app's one connection lifecycle owner, a module-level singleton
 * following the activePairing.ts pattern: a live ChannelController is a
 * stateful crypto object with a transport, not serializable UI state.
 * Screens read channelStore (which this feeds) and call actions.ts (which
 * reads the active connection from here).
 *
 * Lifecycle policy: connect while the app is foregrounded and paired.
 * On background it depends on settings: with backgroundNotificationsMode
 * 'foreground-service' (Android only), hydrated settings, an established
 * connection, and POST_NOTIFICATIONS not known-denied, the channel stays
 * alive under a notifee foreground service and the local notifier turns
 * activity transitions into notifications - for at most five minutes
 * (BACKGROUND_KEEPALIVE_MAX_MS), after which the service stops and the
 * channel is disposed, handing alerting over to remote push. In every other
 * case ('push-only', 'off', iOS, no established connection, settings not yet
 * hydrated, or a permission the user was asked for and refused) the
 * connection is disposed immediately as before (iOS suspends the socket
 * within seconds anyway, the desktop treats a vanished phone fine - relay
 * close tears its subscriptions down - and remote E2E push covers the
 * away-from-app case). iOS 'inactive' (app switcher, permission dialogs)
 * counts as still-active.
 *
 * This module composes pairing (trust anchor), channel, and stores, so it
 * lives in its own src/connection/ directory: src/channel/ stays a pure
 * protocol layer and src/pairing/ already imports channel, so parking the
 * composer in either would tangle the layering. It carries the same
 * accountless-core discipline as both (see .claude/rules/accountless-core.md).

/**
 * Hard ceiling on the background keepalive.
 *
 * Android 15+ gives a dataSync foreground service a 6h/24h budget
 * and kills the process with ForegroundServiceDidNotStopInTimeException when it
 * overruns; notifee 9.1.8 exposes no Service.onTimeout hook, so there is no
 * signal to react to and this timer is the only bound in the stack.
 *
 * It also bounds process LIFETIME, which is how it bears on the REACT-NATIVE-5
 * OOM. Do not read that as "the background path leaks": four measured probes
 * say it does not (see the developer guide). What an unbounded service did was
 * hold the process resident for hours, so ordinary FOREGROUND accumulation - a
 * session screen leaking a WebView per open - was never reset by an OS kill.
 * The ceiling makes the process reapable again; fixing the unmount is the
 * actual repair.
 *
 * Five minutes covers the case the keepalive is actually for - switched apps
 * for a moment. Anything longer is remote push's job, and push covers the same
 * alert categories: the desktop suppresses its own push only while this phone's
 * channel is established, so tearing the channel down hands alerting over
 * rather than dropping it.
 *
 * CORRECTION (MOBILE-3, which recurred on a build that already had this bound).
 * This comment used to reassure that exhausting the budget "would take 72
 * separate background stretches, each running the full five minutes, inside one
 * 24h window". That arithmetic answers a question which cannot arise. Android
 * resets the 6h counter whenever the user brings the app to the foreground, and
 * startBackgroundKeepalive has exactly one caller - the 'background' transition,
 * gated on an established connection, which needs an openConnection from
 * 'active'. So every new window is preceded by a foreground visit that resets
 * the counter, and accumulation across stretches is unreachable.
 *
 * The real constraint is stricter and different: overrunning needs ONE unbroken
 * ~6 hour background stretch in which the service never stopped. Both crash
 * events are exactly that - backgrounded with no foreground afterwards, and the
 * process still alive 7h10m and 14h14m later. So what matters is not how many
 * windows are armed, it is that a single window's teardown always lands. Which
 * is why the ceiling is now enforced two ways: this timer, and a wall-clock
 * check on wake sources that are not Choreographer-driven (see
 * enforceKeepaliveCeiling).
