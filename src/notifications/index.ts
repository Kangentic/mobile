// NOTE the component that performs tap navigation lives in

// here: it pulls in React and expo-router, and this barrel is imported by
// node-env unit tests that cannot parse them. Re-exporting it once made
// tests/unit/notificationsIndex.test.ts die on `SyntaxError: Unexpected token
// 'typeof'`, which is what this note exists to prevent a second time.
//
// That test reaches the barrel through `await import('@/notifications')`, so a
// grep for `from '@/notifications'` will NOT find it and makes this comment look
// stale. It is not. (Same dynamic-import blind spot that
// tests/unit/imperativeRouterConfinement.test.ts exists to cover for the

 * One-shot notification bootstrap, called from index.js at bundle-entry
 * scope (so the notifee background handler and the expo background task
 * are registered outside React, including in headless killed-app task
 * launches) and defensively from the root layout.
 *
 * Split by what is ACTUALLY Android-only rather than gating the lot. This
 * whole function used to return early off Android, which is how iOS ended up
 * with no permission state and no tap routing on top of never being asked for
 * authorization at all. Tap routing is cross-platform (see tapRouter), and the
 * permission cache is what Settings reads to tell an iOS user their
 * notifications are blocked.
 *
 * Still Android-only, by nature: notifee channels (an Android concept), the
 * FCM data-message task, and the foreground service. Rich iOS notification
 * CONTENT still needs the Notification Service Extension, which is a separate
 * slice - until it ships, an iOS push renders as the generic placeholder.
