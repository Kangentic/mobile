/**
 * How a task's linked PR renders on the card, and how it reads out loud.
 *
 * Desktop parity, with one deliberate shape change. The desktop card gives the
 * PR its own row and always labels the chip (`open` / `draft` / `merged` /
 * `closed`); the phone has one title row shared with the status icon, the
 * ticket number and (on the Agents feed) the project pill, so a label here is
 * width taken from the title. The chip therefore grows a word only when merge
 * readiness actually says something - `ready`, `blocked`, `conflicts`,
 * `queued`, `running` - and stays the bare glyph it has always been otherwise.
 * `label === null` means "render the glyph alone".
 *
 * The state/readiness mapping itself is the desktop's, from its
 * `renderer/lib/pr-state.ts`:
 *
 * - Readiness is consulted ONLY while the PR is open. A stale verdict on a
 *   merged PR must never show through, which is why the non-open branches
 *   ignore it rather than falling through to a shared lookup.
 * - `ready` keeps the open green: it is the promise "a merge would land now".
 * - `conflicting` renders the word `conflicts` - the label is NOT the wire
 *   value - in rust rather than red, so it never reads as `closed`.
 * - `queued` / `running` mean a blocking check is still in flight, so they take
 *   a hue that is neither a pass nor a fail.
 * - `unknown`, null, and any value this client does not recognise render as
 *   plain open. That last one is the protocol's own instruction, and it is what
 *   keeps a desktop that grows a seventh verdict from blanking the chip here.
 *
 * Both parameters are plain strings because `@kangentic/protocol` exports no
 * readiness union to narrow against (see
 * `.claude/rules/protocol-types-from-package.md`: a local parallel type would
 * drift from the desktop's, which is the failure this module must not have).

 *
 * A `Map`, deliberately, not an object literal. An object literal inherits
 * `Object.prototype`, so a wire value that happens to name a member of it
 * (`constructor`, `toString`, `valueOf`, `__proto__`) would HIT the lookup and
 * return a function in place of a presentation - the `?? PLAIN_OPEN` fallback
 * never fires, and the card renders a pill with an undefined label and an
 * undefined color. `Map.get` misses cleanly for those keys. This is not
 * hypothetical robustness: the protocol states that a value a client does not
 * know renders as plain open (see `BoardTaskWire.pr_merge_readiness`), and an
 * object literal cannot honour that for every string the wire can carry.
 * `Map.get` also returns `T | undefined`, so the fallback is live code to
 * `tsc` rather than the dead branch an unchecked index signature makes it.
