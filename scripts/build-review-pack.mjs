/**
 * Builds the /code-review shared review pack (REVIEW_PACK.tmp.md) and the pre-existing-dirty
 * list (REVIEW_PREEXISTING_DIRTY.tmp) under --out-dir (default .kangentic/) in one invocation,
 * so the review driver pays one Bash call instead of generating a ~200KB pack through
 * the Write tool (tool input is billed as model output; a 200KB pack costs roughly
 * 100k output tokens if the driver writes it itself).
 *
 * Why it exists: without a shared pack every finder in the fan-out re-runs the git gather
 * and re-reads the same changed files. The desktop repo's code-review fan-out audit
 * (docs/code-review-fanout-audit.md there) measured that at 50-78k tokens of re-derivation per
 * finder with 38% of all Read bytes duplicated across finders; the pack pays it once.
 *
 * A syncer of this file needs nothing but this comment. Everything below the imports is the
 * desktop logic verbatim; if you change it, change it in both repos. Two divergences are in this
 * file, both deliberate:
 *   (a) this header comment;
 *   (b) the explicit `node:buffer` import. This repo's ESLint config supplies React Native
 *       globals, not Node's, so a bare `Buffer` fails `no-undef`, and `npm run lint` is a
 *       required CI check. Keep the import when syncing.
 * The rest of the review flow diverges from desktop in nine ways.
 * .claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md ("Mobile differences") owns that list and its reasons;
 * this copy and CLAUDE.md's follow it, one line each:
 *   1. No HMR vitest: the skill's Step 2 is a placeholder, and scripts/review-verdict.mjs
 *      checks only typecheck and scopedTests.
 *   2. No E2E in the pass: a Maestro coverage hole goes to the grouped follow-up task for /e2e
 *      or CI, never written, never run, never `blocked`.
 *   3. The gated auditors are crypto-pairing-auditor and expo-rn-reviewer.
 *   4. The "try first" packaged-build example is a release build:
 *      `npx expo run:android --variant release --no-bundler`.
 *   5. No commitlint and no .husky/ hook, so desktop's footer-max-line-length change and its
 *      review-ledger-commitlint test do not apply. Re-check if one is ever added.
 *   6. New .mjs files import Node-only globals explicitly ((b) above is the live case).
 *   7. Step 7's scoped run of existing importers covers tests/unit/ (vitest) and
 *      tests/components/ (jest), five files in all.
 *   8. <reviewDir> is the session scratchpad for parity, not because anything here moves
 *      .kangentic/ (desktop's scripts/dev.js does; this repo's scripts/dev.mjs does not).
 *   9. The script header comments, each naming its own divergences.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/build-review-pack.mjs [<baseRef>] [--body-cap <bytes>] [--out-dir <path>]
 *        [--shard-lines <lines>]
 *   baseRef        optional, e.g. "origin/main" or "main". Omitted or empty: working-tree
 *                  changes only (uncommitted + untracked), matching the skill's no-base fallback.
 *   --body-cap     optional byte budget for the body tier (default PACK_BODY_CAP_BYTES). `0`
 *                  renders every readable file at the hunk tier, the "light pack" shape that the
 *                  desktop repo's replay script measures; the review skill never passes it.
 *   --out-dir      optional directory for both output files, resolved against the cwd and created
 *                  if missing. Default: <repo root>/.kangentic/. The review skill passes its session
 *                  scratchpad: it is outside the repo, so neither file can stage, and its fixed name
 *                  lets a driver whose context was compacted find the dirty list again.
 *   --shard-lines  optional line budget per finder shard. Prints a `  shards:` line: the header range
 *                  every shard reads first, then contiguous pack ranges that start on a section
 *                  heading, never split a section, and stay within the budget unless a single
 *                  section alone exceeds it (that section is then a shard of its own).
 *
 * Output files (under --out-dir, or .kangentic/, which is gitignored):
 *   REVIEW_PACK.tmp.md          "Total lines: N", a one-line format legend, a table of contents
 *                               with a start line for EVERY changed file, then one section per
 *                               changed file, largest churn first. There is no separate diff:
 *                               each changed line appears exactly once, in its file's section,
 *                               as `<marker><line number, 5 wide><tab><text>` with "+" added,
 *                               " " unchanged, and "-" removed (no number; shown in place before
 *                               the line that follows it). A file admitted under the body cap is
 *                               "## Full file:" or "## Partial file:" (every changed hunk with 20
 *                               lines of context); every other readable file is "## Changed
 *                               hunks:" (the same renderer at 3 lines of context), unless that
 *                               section alone exceeds the per-file hunk cap, in which case it is
 *                               a one-line "## Changed hunks omitted:" stub. Deleted, binary,
 *                               rename-only, and mode-only files get a one-line section too.
 *   REVIEW_PREEXISTING_DIRTY.tmp  one path per line: tracked-dirty + untracked, captured
 *                               BEFORE the review pass edits anything (Step 8's set math).
 *
 * Prints a compact summary to stdout; never prints the pack itself. One line of that summary is
 * a contract rather than a nicety: `  paths: <a>, <b>, ...` is the authoritative changed-file
 * list the review driver gates its domain auditors on. It is the script's own changedFiles
 * array (the three layers plus any path only the change record names), so it cannot disagree
 * with what the pack was built from. Keep it labelled distinctly from the `changed files:` count
 * line above it.

// A hunk-tier section over this many bytes is replaced by a one-line stub. This is a fact about
// the file alone (like SINGLE_FILE_CAP_BYTES for bodies), never a knapsack over its neighbours: a
// global cap would make a file's presence depend on what else changed, the reorder hazard the
// admission comment below records. Half the body cap: a single file whose changed lines alone
// would take half the pack's body budget is a lockfile, a generated bundle, or a snapshot dump,
// which no finder reads linearly. The pack is therefore bounded by the review's own changed
// lines plus the body cap, not by a constant; docs/code-review-fanout-audit.md section 14
// records how often the corpus hits this ceiling.
const PACK_HUNK_SECTION_CAP_BYTES = 100 * 1024;

// A body is packed as windows around its changed hunks instead of in full when that saves a
// worthwhile share of its bytes. Most of a large file's body is unchanged code that no finder's
// criteria reach, and every pack byte is re-read by up to 11 finders while a file left out is
// read only by the finders that actually want it - so bytes spent on untouched code are the
// pack's worst-value bytes. Measured across eight merged PRs: identical file coverage, packs
// 2% to 71% smaller (docs/code-review-fanout-audit.md, the windowed-bodies section).

const WINDOW_MAX_SHARE_OF_FULL = 0.85; // skip windowing unless it saves at least 15% of the body

// The pack must be a function of the diff alone, not of whoever's git config happens to be in
// scope. This repo is public and `/code-review` runs on other people's machines and in CI, so a
// pack that differs per developer means a different review surface for the same commits - and
// every one of these fails SILENTLY, producing a valid-looking pack rather than an error.
//   quotepath        git octal-escapes non-ASCII path bytes, and the mangled path then fails
//                    every later existsSync lookup.
//   mnemonicPrefix   renames the diff prefixes per source (`c/` commit, `w/` working tree).
//   noprefix,        drop or replace `a/` and `b/`. The parser keys every file off the
//   src/dstPrefix    `+++ b/<path>` header of a COMMIT-vs-WORKING-TREE diff, which is exactly
//                    the case mnemonic prefixes apply to, so any of these three switches the
//                    WHOLE parse off: every file would land in the unparsed residual and no
//                    section would carry a marker. Since the whole pack now renders from that
//                    parse, these pins are more load-bearing than when they only guarded windows.
//   context          no longer reaches any rendered byte (every diff the pack renders is
//                    `--unified=0`, and `--name-only` / `--numstat` ignore it); pinned anyway so
//                    a future call site cannot inherit a personal value.
//   renames          off, a renamed-and-modified file scores zero churn (its numstat key never
//                    matches a real path) and ranks last instead of first.
// These are the values the pack is DEFINED against, not a claim about any git version's
