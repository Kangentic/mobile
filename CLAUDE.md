# Kangentic Mobile

Mobile companion app that remote-controls agent sessions running in the desktop Kangentic app.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Expo SDK 55+, React Native New Architecture, TypeScript strict mode
- **State:** Zustand
- **Lists:** FlashList (transcript feed, board, chat-style streaming)
- **Crypto:** `@kangentic/protocol` (pure TypeScript on `@noble/curves`/`@noble/hashes`/`@noble/ciphers` -
  no native crypto module; the same handshake code runs on Node and Hermes), plus
  `react-native-get-random-values` (CSPRNG polyfill) and `@bacons/text-decoder` (Hermes has no
  built-in `TextDecoder`)
- **Storage:** expo-secure-store (Keychain / Android Keystore)
- **Notifications:** Expo Push, Notifee (Android), a native iOS Notification Service Extension via config plugin
- **Build:** GitHub Actions on free runners for both platforms (Gradle for Android, `xcodebuild` on
  a macOS runner for iOS). EAS is the credential source and the fallback, not the build path.
  Continuous Native Generation (no checked-in native projects)
- **Testing:** vitest (unit), Jest + React Native Testing Library (components), Maestro (E2E, Windows + Android emulator locally and on a CI emulator; on iOS it runs only the store-capture flow on a CI simulator, which navigates but barely asserts, so **there is no iOS E2E suite**), Playwright via react-native-web (later)

## Project Structure

**App Phase 2 (core experience).** `app/` holds thin expo-router route wrappers; the actual
screen implementations and everything else live under `src/`. If the layout changes, update
this tree and the rule `paths:` globs together.

```
app.config.ts                 # Expo config; CNG - config plugins only, no checked-in native projects
eas.json                      # EAS Build/Submit/Workflows profiles (development/preview/e2e/production)
app/                           # expo-router route wrappers (thin - render the src/screens/ implementation)
  _layout.tsx, (tabs)/         # root Stack + native bottom Tabs (Home, Board); boots connection + notifications + splash
  task/[taskId]/               # index.tsx = the SESSION view (terminal/chat/changes segments)
  file-diff.tsx                 # per-file unified diff, pushed over the session's changes segment
  completed-task.tsx            # a finished task's transcript + run summary
  create-task.tsx, edit-task.tsx, move-task.tsx, task-actions.tsx, project-picker.tsx
                                #   native form-sheet routes (they replaced the custom board sheets)
  pair.tsx, pair-confirm.tsx    # pairing flow routes; pair.tsx renders the scan/paste screen
  +native-intent.ts             # deep links; routes ONLY the demo code (kangentic-pair://demo).
                                #   OS routing of a REAL kangentic-pair:// payload is still a later
                                #   phase, deliberately: an arbitrary link must not be able to start
                                #   a ceremony against an attacker-chosen relay

## Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npx expo start --dev-client` (`npm start`) - Start the dev server against a dev-client build
- `npm run dev:mock` / `dev:shots` / `dev:live` / `dev:pair` / `dev:stub` / `dev:doctor` - The local dev rig
  (`scripts/dev.mjs`): emulator + adb reverse + relay + Metro in one command, in mock
  (in-app fake desktop), live (real desktop dev instance), pair (pairing-ceremony testing),
  or stub (Maestro E2E rig) mode; doctor is a read-only preflight. `dev:shots` is mock plus
  the store-capture flag, which silences LogBox so a warning cannot land in a listing image -
  capture only, never UI iteration. See
  [docs/developer-guide.md](docs/developer-guide.md)'s Local Dev Rig section.
- `npx expo run:android` (`npm run android`) - Build, install, and launch the dev client on the
  Android emulator (rebuilds native code; use this after a native dependency or config plugin
  change, or the first time on a fresh emulator)
- `gh workflow run build-android.yml -f profile=<development|preview|e2e|production>` - **The
  normal way to build.** Runs `expo prebuild` + Gradle on a free GitHub runner, spends no EAS
  cloud credit, and uploads the APK/AAB as a run artifact. Add `-f submit_track=internal` to queue
  a Play upload (gated behind an approval). See the CI builds section of
  [docs/developer-guide.md](docs/developer-guide.md).
- `gh workflow run build-ios.yml` - **The normal way to build for iOS.** Runs on a free macOS
  runner. Defaults to an unsigned simulator compile check, which needs no Apple Developer account
  and no signing. Add `-f target=device` for a signed `.ipa`, and `-f submit=testflight` to upload
  it to App Store Connect. The upload talks to Apple directly with `xcrun altool`, so an EAS Submit
  outage cannot block it. See the CI builds section of
  [docs/developer-guide.md](docs/developer-guide.md).
- The `eas build` wrappers below are **cloud** builds that each spend one of the 15 free monthly
  builds per platform and enter a low-priority queue that can take hours. Prefer the workflows above;
  use these only when a runner will not do:
  - `eas build --profile development --platform android` (`npm run build:dev`) - dev-client build
  - `eas build --profile preview --platform android` (`npm run build:preview`) - internal
    distribution build
  - `eas build --profile production --platform android` (`npm run build:prod`) - store-release build
  - `eas build --profile production --platform ios` - App Store build (cloud, no Mac needed). The
    fallback if the runner path breaks; `build-ios.yml -f target=device` is the path.
- `npm run typecheck` - `tsc --noEmit`. A `pretypecheck` hook runs
  `scripts/checkInstallDrift.mjs` first, which fails fast when this checkout resolves
  `@kangentic/protocol` from **another** checkout's `node_modules` (every worktree lives inside
  the main one, so Node walks up and finds it) or at a version outside the declared range. That
  drift presents as a wall of "has no exported member" errors in files nobody touched, and the
  obvious way to check them - stash, re-run, "same before and after, so pre-existing" - confirms
  the wrong answer, because both runs resolve the same stale package. Fix: `npm install`.
  Run it alone with `npm run check:install`.
- `npm run clean:staging` / `verify:staging` - prune and check the relocated CMake staging root
  (`%SystemDrive%\kangentic\android`). `withAndroidCmakeBuildStaging` moves each module's `.cxx`
  out of the checkout so a build works from any path depth, at the cost of output that survives
  `gradlew clean` and accumulates one tree per branch. `verify:staging` is the only check that
  proves the object-path flag reached CMake rather than merely reaching `settings.gradle`.
- `npm run lint` - `eslint . --max-warnings 0`
- `npm run test:unit` - Unit Tests (`vitest run tests/unit`)
- `npm run test:components` - Component Tests (`jest tests/components`)
- `maestro --device <serial> test .maestro/smoke.yaml` - the unpaired smoke flow against the
  Android emulator. The paired suite is a separate command with setup:
  `maestro --device <serial> test .maestro/paired` needs a relay plus
  `scripts/stubDesktopPeer.mjs` and a completed pairing first, which `/e2e` sequences for you.
  **Never `maestro test .maestro/`**: the bare root sweeps in the `setup/` rig fixture, which
  fails for lacking a `PAIRING_URI` and reads as a broken pairing screen rather than a
  misconfigured command.
- `eas update` - Push a JS-only OTA update

## Cloud-spend and public-write MCP tools

Four MCP servers are wired in: `context7`, `firebase` and `sentry` from `.mcp.json`, plus the
official Expo plugin from `enabledPlugins` in `.claude/settings.json`. `context7` is
documentation-only and unguarded; the Expo plugin, `firebase` and `sentry` expose tools with
consequences outside this machine, gated by `permissions.ask` in `.claude/settings.json` (a
prompt on every call in every normal permission mode; a bypass mode skips it, so this section,
not the prompt, is the real guard) - never call these without an explicit user request, and
re-check this list against `/mcp` when any server is upgraded.

**The Maestro MCP server was removed deliberately** (2026-07-25). It is `maestro mcp`, a wrapper
over the same CLI, so it added no capability: `run`/`inspect_screen`/`list_devices`/`run_on_cloud`
are `maestro test`/`hierarchy`/`list-devices`/`cloud`. It did add a second device driver that
contended with the dev rig's and then hung rather than erroring (over two minutes on calls as
small as `cheat_sheet`, while the CLI answered in seconds), ten tool schemas of context per
session, and a cloud-spend tool this section had to guard in prose. Drive Maestro with the CLI;
see `.claude/rules/e2e-maestro-runs.md`.

- **Never without an explicit request - spends money or quota:** `build_run`, `build_submit`,
  `workflow_run` (Expo MCP). `maestro cloud` on the CLI bills Maestro Cloud minutes and carries
  the same bar. `build_run` spends one of the Expo Free allowance of 15 iOS + 15 Android **cloud**
  builds per month, and it is no longer how this project builds:
  `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` runs `expo prebuild` plus Gradle on a free GitHub runner,
  so a normal build costs no EAS credit at all. Reach for the workflow, not `build_run`. EAS is
  still the path for a manual `eas submit`, so `build_submit` is "explicit request only" rather
  than "never our path". Note the Expo MCP authenticates as the individual developer's
  **personal** Expo account via `/mcp` OAuth, and CI holds no Expo credential whatsoever, so
  anything the MCP fires is both off-path and attributed to a personal identity (see the auth
  table in [docs/developer-guide.md](docs/developer-guide.md)'s Agent tooling section).
- **Never without an explicit request, higher bar - posts publicly and is effectively
  irreversible:** `appstore_reply_review`, `appstore_delete_review_response`,
  `playstore_reply_review` (Expo MCP). These write to real App Store and Play Store listings
  under the company identity. Confirm the exact text with the user before posting, every time.
- **Never without an explicit request, higher bar - reaches real devices:**
  `messaging_send_message` (Firebase MCP). This delivers an FCM push to real installs. It also
  cannot satisfy `.claude/rules/e2e-notification-privacy.md`, which requires every payload to be
  ciphertext plus a generic placeholder: a console-style FCM send is plaintext by construction.
  Use it only to debug delivery mechanics with the user's explicit say-so, never as a way to
  send app content.
- **Never without an explicit request - creates or mutates cloud resources:**
  `firebase_create_project`, `firebase_create_app`, `firebase_create_android_sha`,
  `firebase_deploy`, `firebase_init`, `firebase_update_environment` (Firebase MCP). The Firebase
  MCP is scoped to `--only core,messaging` in `.mcp.json` because this app uses Firebase solely
  for FCM. Widen that list only when a feature is actually adopted. Note `firebase_init` writes
  a `firebase.json` into the repo, which this project deliberately does not have.
- **Reads are fine, writes need an explicit request - mutates a shared issue tracker:** the
  Sentry MCP (remote HTTP, `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp/kangentic/react-native`, OAuth as the
  individual developer's personal Sentry account). Querying issues, events, and stack traces is
  ordinary read-only debugging and needs no ceremony. Anything that WRITES - resolving or
  ignoring an issue, assigning it, editing alert rules, creating or deleting a project or team,
  or triggering a Seer/autofix run that spends quota - is explicit-request-only, because the
  issue stream is the project's shared record of what is broken and a bulk resolve is tedious to
  undo. The URL is deliberately scoped to the one project rather than the org: it narrows the
  blast radius and drops the org-wide discovery tools from context. Note that crash events
  themselves are app data; treat anything read out of them as covered by
  `.claude/rules/crash-reporting-scope.md` and never paste an event payload into a public
  artifact. To actually investigate an issue, reach for `/sentry` rather than this MCP: it hits
  the REST API by numeric project id, so a project rename cannot silently point it at nothing,
  and it carries the diagnosis and duplicate-guard steps this bullet does not.

## Architecture

Full detail lives in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and
[docs/security.md](docs/security.md); this is the always-visible summary.

- **Pairing:** the desktop displays a QR (its static public key, a short-lived single-use
  high-entropy token, a relay address, a protocol version), the phone scans it. The token is
  mixed into the Noise handshake as a **pre-shared key**, not used in a PAKE - this is a
  deliberate deviation from the original research doc's SPAKE2 recommendation; see
  `docs/security.md` for why a high-entropy scanned token makes a PAKE unnecessary. After the
  handshake, both sides confirm a transcript-derived SAS (Short Authentication String) before
  the pairing completes.
- **Secure channel:** every session runs a fresh Noise KK handshake
  (`Noise_KK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s`) over a blind, self-hostable relay
  (`relay`, a separate repo) that forwards ciphertext only. The desktop always
  initiates the KK handshake and owns the ~2 minute rekey timer; the phone is the responder.
  Version negotiation is bound into the prologue to close downgrade attacks.
- **Capability allowlist:** the channel proves which device is connected; a desktop-enforced
  allowlist decides what it may do. Ten verbs (`read-stream`, `read-board`, `read-diff`,
  `send-user-message`, `move-task`, `answer-permission-prompt`, `interactive-terminal`,
  `board-tool-read`, `board-tool-write`, `register-push`); **the default pairing grant is all
  ten** (`DEFAULT_PAIRING_CAPABILITIES` in the desktop's `pairing-service.ts` - pairing proves
  possession of both devices, so pairing is the approval). The per-verb allowlist exists to
  NARROW a device from the desktop's devices panel, not as a default-deny gate.
  **There is no shell, file, or arbitrary-command verb in the protocol - absent, not filtered.**
- **Session view (three surfaces):** a task's screen is one SESSION with a full-width segmented
  switcher as its primary navigation - Terminal (the raw mirror, the default), Chat (the
  readable feed), and Changes - all three pager pages of the one screen, not pushed
  destinations. Chat renders the structured transcript when the agent
  has one, and degrades agent-agnostically to a cleaned live reading view derived from the
  terminal (a headless xterm in the WebView) when it does not.
- **Transcript-terminal rendering:** the chat lens renders the transcript styled as a
  terminal, reflowed to phone width, with `AskUserQuestion`/permission prompts as tappable
  cards; the in-progress turn streams token-by-token as a cleaned tail of the raw PTY feed
  (`src/terminal/liveTail.ts`), replaced when the next transcript revision lands. The raw
  interactive terminal (xterm.js in a WebView, quick-key bar, `interactive-terminal` writes)
  renders at the desktop's reported PTY grid and is a **faithful read-only mirror**: it mirrors
  that grid 1:1 with pan and pinch-zoom, sizing the font so the grid's rows fill the screen
  height, and it **never resizes the desktop PTY** - a shared session must not be reshaped by the
  phone. Typed input is the only thing the phone sends. The protocol's `resize` / `release-size`
  actions exist for the desktop, not this client (`src/channel/verbClient.ts`); a phone-requested
  grid was built, live-tested, and removed the same day as LESS readable than the desktop's own
  layout (see `docs/terminal-ownership-design.md`). Instead, the desktop rests unwatched
  sessions at a detail-shaped 210x48 grid, so the mirror looks the same whether a desktop
  surface shows the session or not.
- **E2E push:** payloads are ciphertext plus a generic placeholder only; decryption happens
  on-device (iOS Notification Service Extension / Android Notifee). Every failure degrades to
  the placeholder, never to plaintext. That is a floor on WHAT IS RENDERED, not a promise that
  something always renders: the Android message is data-only (no `title`, no `body`, and no
  `channelId` - any of the three makes FCM draw the notification itself and skip the app's
  handler entirely), so if the on-device handler never runs there is no OS fallback behind it.
- **Accountless core:** pairing, transport, and capability code never depend on any Kangentic
  account or entitlement layer. The open-core split (this app is open source and self-hostable;
  a Kangentic-operated hosted relay is the paid product) depends on this separation holding.
- **CNG:** native config flows through `app.config.ts` and Expo config plugins under `plugins/`.
  `ios/` and `android/` are gitignored prebuild artifacts, never hand-edited or committed.

## Testing

Four tiers, chosen for the fastest tier that proves the behavior. Full detail:
[docs/developer-guide.md](docs/developer-guide.md).

**Always fine:**
- `npm run typecheck` - run freely at any point.
- Running tests you just added or modified, scoped to those files.

**Never run unless the user explicitly asks, or `/test` is executing:**
- An unscoped full-tier run - `npx vitest run` with no path, or either Maestro suite in full
  (`.maestro/smoke.yaml`, `.maestro/paired`).

If a run would execute tests you did not add or modify, it is a full-tier run regardless of
mechanism: stop and let `/test` handle it.

**Maestro note:** `.maestro/smoke.yaml` runs against a fresh (unpaired) install; the flows under
`.maestro/paired/` need a running relay plus `node scripts/stubDesktopPeer.mjs` and a completed
pairing first (each flow's header documents the setup). Run flows with the **CLI**
(`maestro --device <serial> test <path>`), one rig mode at a time, and read
`.claude/rules/e2e-maestro-runs.md` before touching a flow - the dev client imposes several
non-obvious constraints and each one fails as a full-timeout hang rather than an error.

**Which stage owns which verification.** CI is the enforced gate, not the local machine:
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `e2e.yml` run on every PR and are required on `main`. So do NOT run
the Maestro suite locally before opening a pull request. Two reasons: E2E is single-tenant (one
emulator, one relay port, one paired identity), so it serialises every task on the board; and it
duplicates the gate that actually cannot be bypassed.

**Local Android builds work from any path**, including a task worktree.
`plugins/withAndroidCmakeBuildStaging.ts` relocates each module's CMake staging directory to a
short absolute root (`%SystemDrive%\kangentic\android`), which removes checkout depth from the
equation. **Never create a drive-root build directory to work around a path problem**, and never
create one at all without asking: if a build hits MAX_PATH, fix the plugin.

An APK is bound to the dependency tree that built it, and that has not changed: **run `npm
install` in the worktree before building.** A worktree starts with `node_modules` as a junction to
the main checkout, and a dev client whose native libs came from a different checkout dies as a
native `SIGABRT` in `libworklets.so` with no JS error. See `docs/developer-guide.md`'s "Local
Android builds work from any path", which `/preview` routes through.

What IS in scope while implementing: `npm run typecheck`, the tests you touched, and - if the
change touches a screen a flow already covers - that **single flow**, which takes well under a
minute. One targeted flow is scoped work, not a full-tier run. The suite is `/test`'s job.

## Conventions

Enforceable standards live as focused, auto-loaded rules in `.claude/rules/`. Rules without a
`paths:` header load every session; rules with one load when you touch matching files. Each rule
names its enforcement (live now, or planned where mechanical coverage does not exist yet).

**Always-on rules:**
- `bash-single-command.md` - one command per Bash tool call; no `&&` `||` `|` `;` or redirects.
- `text-formatting.md` - no em-dashes (U+2014) or `--` as punctuation in authored text.
- `typescript-style.md` - TypeScript strict mode; no `any` types; full descriptive names.
- `no-personal-info.md` - no usernames, emails, or machine paths in committed code (repo is public).

**Path-scoped rules (load with their subsystem):**
- `protocol-types-from-package.md` - wire/crypto/capability types come only from
  `@kangentic/protocol`, never redeclared (`src/**`).
- `accountless-core.md` - pairing/transport/capability code has no account/entitlement imports
  (`src/pairing/`, `src/channel/`, `src/connection/`, `src/demo/`, `src/devsupport/`,
  `src/notifications/`, `app/+native-intent.ts`).
- `e2e-notification-privacy.md` - push payloads are ciphertext plus placeholder only
  (`src/notifications/`, `plugins/`, `targets/`).
- `crash-reporting-scope.md` - Sentry imports confined to `src/observability/` and banned outright
  from the pairing/channel/demo/devsupport/notification paths; privacy controls set at the source
  because a JS `beforeSend` cannot filter native crashes (`src/observability/`, `src/pairing/`,
  `src/channel/`, `src/demo/`, `src/devsupport/`, `src/notifications/`, `app/+native-intent.ts`).
- `expo-cng.md` - no hand-edited `ios/`/`android/`; native config via config plugins; SDK-resolved
  dependency installs via `expo install` (`app.json`, `app.config.*`, `eas.json`, `plugins/`,
  `ios/`, `android/`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`).
- `secure-storage.md` - long-lived secrets in `expo-secure-store`, never AsyncStorage
  (`src/pairing/`, `src/channel/`, `src/notifications/`, `src/state/`).
- `ui-conventions.md` - shared primitives, font floor, FlashList, testIDs (`src/screens/`,
  `src/components/`).
- `motion-conventions.md` - the frequency gate, `MotionTokens`/`useMotionPresets` vocabulary,
  transform-and-opacity only, no `entering` on a FlashList item root, reduced motion ships with
  the animation, haptics through the `HapticCue` union (`src/components/`, `src/screens/`).
- `ui-copy-brevity.md` - labels name the action, context names the object; one-line
  descriptions; a11y labels exempt (`src/screens/`, `src/components/`).
- `e2e-maestro-runs.md` - Maestro through the CLI, one rig mode, testID selectors, the dev-client
  constraints (`.maestro/`, `scripts/stubDesktopPeer.mjs`, `scripts/dev.mjs`).
- `docs-stay-in-sync.md` - update docs when changing anchor source files.

**Local overrides:** there is no per-rule local file. Put machine-specific instruction overrides
in a gitignored `CLAUDE.local.md` at the project root.

**Other conventions (workflow, not extracted to rules):**
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- A plain **local commit** goes through `/commit`: it stages and commits on the current branch
  only, with no push and no rebase. A bare request to "commit" means `/commit`.
- **Landing changes goes through a PR by default.** The board drives it: the **Tests** column
  runs `/pull-request` (commit, conventional branch, push, create the PR, drive its CI checks to
  green), and the **Ship It** column runs `/merge-pull-request` (merge the green PR, pull back to
  local `main`). For a deliberate direct quick-push that bypasses the PR gate, use `/merge-back`.
  Only push, land, or merge when the user explicitly asks.
- `/commit`, `/pull-request`, `/merge-pull-request`, and `/merge-back` all write conventional-commit
  messages.
- `/sync-docs` keeps `docs/` aligned with source; the doc-anchor check runs inside `/pull-request`
  (commit time) and `/merge-pull-request` (merge time), and `/merge-back` for direct pushes.
- `/store-screenshots` re-captures the Play and App Store listing images across all four shelves.
  Run it whenever the captured screens, the mock content, or the tab bar change - the copy is IN
  the frames, so all four shelves drift together. It sequences the platforms deliberately: iOS
  costs ~45 minutes on a macOS runner per attempt, Android ~6 minutes each locally.
- `/sentry` retrieves and diagnoses issues from the `mobile` Sentry project, and files a
  follow-up board task when asked.

### Authoring a rule

When you codify a new convention, add it as a `.claude/rules/*.md` file following the existing
ones:

1. **One concern per file**, with a descriptive kebab-case filename.
2. **Decide loading, and keep always-on rules few.** Always-on rules (no frontmatter) load every
   session and cost context every session, so reserve them for universal, file-independent
   conventions. Everything subsystem-specific gets `paths:` frontmatter. Treat ~4 always-on as
   a soft ceiling.
3. **Mind the read-trigger gap.** A path-scoped rule loads when a matching file is read into
   context, not when Claude creates a new file in that path. So (a) any convention that must
   hold at file-creation time belongs in an always-on rule or a hook, never path-scoped-only;
   and (b) every path-scoped rule should have a backstop (a future test, or a review-time
   auditor agent) so a missed load is still caught.
4. **Structure:** a one-paragraph context (the problem / the bug it prevents), `## The rule`
   (prescriptive), `## Enforcement (self-maintaining)`, and `## Scope`.
5. **Name an enforcement, strongest available.** A hook blocks 100%; a test or lint rule runs in
   CI; a review-time auditor agent or `/code-review` is the probabilistic fallback. Flag
   explicitly where mechanical coverage is missing - the harness exists (vitest, Jest + RNTL,
   Maestro, ESLint, `tsc`, all gated in `ci.yml`), so "planned" now means not yet written, not
   impossible. Only a few conventions (shorthand names, UI copy brevity) resist mechanization
   outright and stay review-only by design.
6. **Update the index above** with a one-line pointer, and add a backlink from the enforcing
   agent or skill so the rule stays the single source of truth.
7. **Route agents deliberately.** When authoring or updating a skill, decide whether it needs a
   fresh context (a review or audit skill) or should fork the current session (continuing an
   in-flight task); never route a mutating skill to a read-only agent type.

**Linting:** live. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs each check as its own parallel job, and each
job name is a required status check on the protected `main`: `Lint (ESLint)`, `Type check (tsc)`,
`Unit Tests (Vitest)`, `Component Tests (Jest)`, `Native config (prebuild)`, and
`Release counters (stores)` (pull requests only). Renaming a job
renames the required check, so main's branch protection must be updated in the same change.
Conventions with no mechanical check of their own (shorthand names, em-dashes, personal info, UI
copy brevity) remain enforced by review (`/code-review`, `crypto-pairing-auditor`,
`expo-rn-reviewer`) rather than mechanically.
