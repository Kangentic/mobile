/**
 * Android manifest additions for the notification stack (CNG: never
 * hand-edit android/):
 * - POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+ runtime permission; requested in-app on
 *   the first session establishment, see connectionManager's
 *   maybeRequestNotificationPermission. Declaring it here does NOT request it,
 *   and for a while nothing did: the request function existed with no caller
 *   but tests, so every install ran with notifications undeliverable.)
 * - FOREGROUND_SERVICE + FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC (the background
 *   "stay connected" service that keeps the secure channel alive). That service
 *   is bounded to five minutes per background stretch, but nothing here
 *   enforces it, and the bound lives in three places:
 *   BACKGROUND_KEEPALIVE_MAX_MS in connectionManager.ts decides WHEN to stop
 *   (a timer plus a wall-clock check, since a JS timer alone did not hold -
 *   see MOBILE-3), foregroundService.ts owns whether the stop actually LANDS,
 *   and modules/foreground-service-guard is a native AlarmManager stop armed at
 *   every start. That last one is the bound that holds when JS is not running,
 *   which is what MOBILE-3's recurrence on 0.8.0+13 showed. Its receiver is
 *   declared in that module's own manifest, not here. Declaring the permission
 *   grants no time budget of its own.
 * - foregroundServiceType="dataSync" on notifee's foreground service
 *   (mandatory on Android 14+: an FGS must declare its type or crash at
 *   startForeground time)
